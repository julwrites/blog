So as part of my new lifestyle, I've been cycling to and from work. This has had several benefits, one of which is that I am actually getting exercise despite not having dedicated time to go for classes. Another is that it serves to keep me from using my phone instead, which I admit I spend too much time on. 

Since I am unable to use my eyes and hands for anything other than cycling - until I develop so much more skill that I can cycle from peripheral vision alone - I decided to get back into podcasts. So I picked up a couple of podcasts and have been following them. TED is a nice one, and so is Stuff You Should Know. I have particularly enjoyed the Craig Groschel Leadership Podcast and the John Maxwell Executive Leadership Podcast, both of which focus on Leadership principles that I have come to appreciate more and more as I step into positions of greater leadership. 

One of the people whom Craig Groschel interviews was Patrick Lencioni, who wrote the Five Dysfunctions of a Team, and more recently the Six Types of Working Genius. And as he introduced these on the podcast, I thought to myself that these did indeed reveal - and in a very non-judgemental manner - why some people are just not able to do some jobs, and why being promoted into a position of incompetence is a very real thing. 

## The Six Types of Working Genius

So the six types are as follows; 

Wonder; the genius of pondering or dreaming or questioning the things we observe around us
Invention; the genius of imagining and creating new ideas or solutions
Discernment; the genius of identifying good or bad ideas, and tweaking them to work better
Galvanizing; the genius of inspiring and rallying people to a common cause
Enablement; the genius of helping the team to move toward the common goal
Tenacity; the genius of persisting till the end and making sure things are done right

This is, of course, a very very short version. I appreciated the book a lot, which goes through the process of thinking about these problems from the point of view of a fictional character. Most of the book is actually the story, and through the story the six types appear and form an image in the readers' mind about that archetype. 

How do you know which type you are? In short, ask yourself which of the six energize you, or give you great joy in doing. Some people with Tenacity, for example, and perfectly happy to tick things off their task list, as if it was the ticking that gave them joy and not the task; and perhaps it actually is.

Why am I excited about this?

That's a good question. Perhaps I see how it works across all the different realms of work, whether things that need to be done at home, work in the office, doing something for ministry, and so on. It helps me to recognize that I do have areas of strength which I ought to play to, but also areas of weakness that I had better try to address - at least to shore them up enough that I am not exhuasted doing them - and yet other areas that I might be quite good at, but do not energize me and bring me joy.

## I am fortunate

I must say I am fortunate to have landed a position where my Working Genius - the two which energize me and give me joy - is a close match for my role and responsibilities, and my Working Competencies - the two which we neither like nor dislike - are both useful in my role. On the flip side, I see why I had such an aversion to the work I did increasingly in Autodesk as I moved up the ladder, which fell directly into my Working Frustration - the two which drain me and make me unhappy. 

I recognize that not everyone is so fortunate, and there are many around me who are actively working in, or even stuck, in their Working Frustrations. This can be extremely demoralizing, as you would be working against the current of your own God-given nature.
