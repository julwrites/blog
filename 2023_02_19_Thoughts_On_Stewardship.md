Recently I was talking with one of my mentees, and we were discussing his decision-making process with regard to higher education. I was encouraging him to think longer-term, as I often do with my mentees, and to consider what he was really hoping to do with his life and career. 

One of the Bible verses which has influenced me greatly in this regard is Luke 12:48. From a young age, I have recognized that I am blessed to be in my circumstances, and that not many in today's world have the privilege to enjoy what I do. And along with that privilege, I also feel a responsibility to do something with it. Noblesse oblige, one might say. The verse says it better, I think; from everyone who have been given much, much will be demanded.

## Perspective on Stewardship

Perhaps my view is somewhat limited, but I think I consume much the same media as the average first-world citizen. And in this media I see a few messages which are worrying - mostly because they are effective in influencing those who are still forming their own world view. 

One of these messages is the idea that we deserve better. Now, I wish everyone did get better, but I take issue with the idea that everyone deserves better. This implies that everyone has unassailable rights, and that these rights must be accorded them no matter the circumstance. The right to free speech, for example, or the right to love.

## Fatherhood is Stewardship

## Work is Stewardship
